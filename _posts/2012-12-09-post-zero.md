Well folks, this is it... post zero.

The blog has been built. Decisions
have been made. Platforms chosen. Layouts constructed. The CSS has been tweaked and tuned to the best of my aesthetically
challenged abilities. Plugins were added. Plugins were
removed. Several different [Jekyll][1] configurations were implemented
and subsequently tossed aside. All with the intended goal of reaching this moment
right now. The first post.

And now we are here. All excuses for not producing tangible content
systematically decimated. I guess the only thing left to do is `git
commit` this thing and get to work on a real post.
