Welcome to the very first post on my blog. This blog will be used for
some really awesome stuff. Trust me, you won't want to miss it. Lorem
ipsum delor and friends.

Here is some cool code:

{% highlight ruby %}
class BlogPost
  
  def initialize(content)
    @content = content
  end

  def awesome?
    @content == awesome
  end

end

BlogPost.new.awesome?
 => true
{% endhighlight %}

Here is some more text that comes after the post. This will provide some
space between the code listing and the recent posts thing. Maybe it will
look better?
